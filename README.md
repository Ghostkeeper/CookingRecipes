Cooking Recipes
===============

This is a collection of recipes that I use at home to cook food.

I wanted to keep track of these in version control since I tend to make adjustments to them fairly often. Then I thought that since it's in Git, I might as well just publish them here.

Since I have an induction stove with timers, stuff tends to be fairly easy to reproduce exactly for me. If you try to reproduce these recipes using different pans, a different stove and a different oven, your experience will be different. You should at least be able to gauge the relative stove power and such though.

Most of the recipes in this repository are meat items only, at the moment. I tend to not eat starchy foods for dinner, fruit uncooked and vegetables cooked by intuition. I may write some of those down at some point too. We'll see.
