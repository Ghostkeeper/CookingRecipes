Recipe for Steak
================
Cooking duration for how I prefer my steak.

Ingredients
-----------
- Steak, 2 pieces, 250-300g

Algorithm
---------
1. Pre-heat the pan.
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: ~2 minutes, until it starts to smoke.
	- Power: 9
	- Oil: Medium
2. Bake the steak.
	- Duration: 8 minutes (adjust for thicker or thinner pieces).
	- Power: 6
3. Don't turn the steak too often. 2 times is fine.

Criticism
---------
- The edges are a little cold.
- Consider going slightly longer. +1 minute?
