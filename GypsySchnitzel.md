Recipe for Gypsy schnitzel
============================
Pre-made schnitzels from Albert Heijn. Somewhat spicy ones. Easy to make since you just have to heat it up.

Ingredients

- One tray of pre-made Gypsy schnitzel (300g)

Algorithm
---------
1. Bake:
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 15 minutes
	- Power: 6
	- Oil: Medium
2. Turn every 4 minutes or so.

Criticism
---------
- Still quite soggy. Try less oil? Makes it more prone to burning though.
