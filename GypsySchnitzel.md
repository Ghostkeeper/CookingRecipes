Recipe for Gypsy schnitzel
============================
Pre-made schnitzels from Albert Heijn. Somewhat spicy ones. Easy to make since you just have to heat it up.

Ingredients
-----------
- One tray of pre-made Gypsy schnitzel (300g)

Algorithm
---------
1. Bake:
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 13 minutes
	- Power: 6
	- Oil: Light

Criticism
---------
- Lot of variation in burntness depending on oil? Needs tweaking.
- Always becomes soft. Isn't there a way to get it crunchy? Adding oil only makes it more soggy, but maybe with significantly longer cooking?
