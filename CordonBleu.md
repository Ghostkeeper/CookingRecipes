Recipe for cordon bleu
======================
Easy and delicious, but it takes a significant time to cook and properly melt the cheese.

Ingredients
-----------
- One tray of cordon bleu filets (350g)

Algorithm
---------
1. Bake:
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 14 minutes
	- Power: 6
	- Oil: Medium

Criticism
---------
- The cheaper version of this is easier to cook.
- Tends to fall apart, leaking out the cheese.
- The thick parts have not been cooked through entirely.
- The breading will burn on the pan a bit, but it doesn't affect the taste yet.
