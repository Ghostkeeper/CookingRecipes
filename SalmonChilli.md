Recipe for Salmon Chilli
========================
A juicy salmon steak with chilli spices.

Ingredients
-----------
- Salmon steak, ~200g
- Honey, 2 tablespoons
- Soy sauce
- Garlic, 2 cloves
- Chilli peppers or powder, to taste

Algorithm
---------
1. Put the salmon in a bowl.
2. Chop up the garlic and spread it over the top of it.
3. Pour the soy sauce on top, enough to hit every part of the salmon.
4. Pour the honey on top.
5. Let it sit for about half an hour to marinade.
6. Crush the chilli peppers (unless you use powder).
7. Pre-heat the pan, but not as far as smoke.
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: ~1 minute, not as far as smoking.
	- Power: 9
	- Oil: Medium
8. Bake the salmon.
	- Duration: 4 minutes (the inside must be moist and pink, but not the original colour)
	- Power: 7
	- With lid
9. Turn frequently. The honey burns quickly in the pan.
10. After cooking, spread the chilli pepper on top of the salmon steak.

Criticism
---------
- Hard to prevent the honey from getting black, but it doesn't significantly affect the taste.
- Need more chilli or something else to make it spicier.
