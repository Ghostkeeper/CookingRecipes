Recipe for bimi
===============
Healthy stuff, but since it's done in the oven can be quite time consuming before bimi consuming happens.

Ingredients
-----------
- 200g bimi
- Salt
- Pepper
- Sesame oil
- Sesame seeds

Algorithm
---------
1. Pre-heat the oven for 180 degrees (15 minutes).
2. Prepare a tray of bimi for the oven.
3. Sprinkle on the salt, peper, sesame seeds and finally the sesame oil.
4. Bake the bimi in the oven for 15 minutes.

Criticism
---------
- Don't use so much oil. Instead of sprinking, maybe rubbing oil on the bimi might be better?
- Can we reduce the cooking time by inserting the bimi in the oven before pre-heating it?
