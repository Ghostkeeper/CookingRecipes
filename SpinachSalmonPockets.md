Recipe for Salmon Pockets with Spinach Sauce
--------------------------------------------
Crispy pockets of salmon in bread with spinach sauce inside.

Again though, this is basically a pre-packaged meal that we only have to heat up.

Algorithm
---------
1. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C. This takes about 12 minutes.
2. Put the salmon in the oven for 25 minutes.
