Recipe for fish sticks
======================
How long to bake frozen fish sticks.

Ingredients
-----------
- 1 box of fish sticks (~450g).

Algorithm
---------
1. Cook the fish sticks in the air fryer
	- 200C
	- 10 minutes

Criticism
---------
* Not very crunchy. Maybe that's the low-fat reality, but maybe cooking it hotter helps.
* Maybe stack them such that they can aerate their water better? Or maybe defrost them beforehand? Less soggy will be more crunchy.
