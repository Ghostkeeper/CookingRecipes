Recipe for salty-sweet nasi
===========================
This recipe has been perfected over years of using it as back-up when I didn't know what to have for dinner. Also good to serve a lot of people.

Ingredients per person
----------------------
- 250mL of uncooked rice
- 1 chicken filet (~150g)
- 150g of Chinese Wok vegetables from Albert Heijn, consisting of:
	- White cauliflower
	- Green beans
	- Bell pepper
	- Leek
	- Taugee
- A dash of sesame oil
- Sesame seeds
- 50mL dark soy sauce
- 50mL Worchestershire sauce
- 50mL maple syrup
- A dash of MSG to taste
- 50g cashews

Algorithm
---------
1. Cook the rice.
	- If you feel extra enthousiastic, cook the rice several hours beforehand and cool it in an open bowl in the fridge. This dries the rice and makes it more tangy in the final dish.
2. Bake the rice.
	- Pan: Dimpled wok
	- Duration: ~12 minutes in total
	- Power: 10
	- Oil: Generous, and use the sesame oil
3. Cut the intestines and other nasty stuff from the chicken.
4. Dice the chicken (large dice, bite-sized).
5. Mix the soy sauce, Worchestershire, maple syrup and MSG in a small cup.
6. About 7 minutes after starting the baking of the rice, add the chicken, cashews, sesame seeds and sauce. Mix it in the pan.
7. About 3 minutes later, add the vegetables.

Variations
----------
1. Use peanuts instead of cashew.
2. If you don't have dark soy sauce, use twice as much light soy sauce.
3. Use honey instead of maple syrup.
