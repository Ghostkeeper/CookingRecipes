Recipe for chewy chocolate chip cookies
---------------------------------------
Based on a recipe by my grandmother (yes, for real), with adjustments by my father and me.

Ingredients
-----------
- 300g flour (575mL)
- 200g brown sugar (175mL, pressed)
- 180g crystal sugar (175mL)
- 200g butter
- 1 medium egg
- 1 tea spoon baking soda
- 1 tea spoon vanilla flavouring
- 1/2 tea spoon salt
- 350g M&M's or other form of chocolate chips

Algorithm
---------
1. Melt the butter. Be careful for explosions in the microwave. Melt it slowly!
2. Put in a bowl:
	- The flour
	- The brown sugar
	- The crystal sugar
	- The butter
	- The egg
	- The baking soda
	- The vanilla
	- The salt
3. Pre-heat the oven to 190Â°C.
4. Mix until the content of the bowl is crumbly.
	- Start with a fork to prevent covering the kitchen in flour.
	- If it stays dusty, your butter wasn't molten enough. Put the whole bowl in the microwave and heat it up a bit.
5. Add:
	- M&M's or another form of chocolate chips.
6. Continue mixing until the dough is still crumbly but sticks together in large clumps.
7. Prepare oil on an oven tray. Spread it around with a spatula.
8. Take a big spoon of dough per cookie, roll up in ~4cm balls, put it on the tray.
9. Bake the tray for 8 minutes in the oven.
10. Squish the cookies with a spatula. Then use two spatulas to pick them up.
11. Let it cool down on a cloth.
12. Re-apply the oil for the next tray, and repeat until the dough is spent.
