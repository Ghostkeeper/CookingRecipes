Recipe for chewy chocolate chip cookies
---------------------------------------

Based on a recipe by my grandmother (yes, for real), with adjustments by my father and me.

1. Put in a bowl:
	- 300g flower (575mL)
	- 175mL brown sugar (pressed)
	- 175mL crystal sugar
	- 200g butter (molten, but careful for explosions in the microwave, so take it slow!)
	- 1 medium egg
	- 1 tea spoon baking soda
	- 1 tea spoon vanilla flavouring
	- 1/2 tea spoon salt
2. Pre-heat the oven to 190Â°C.
3. Mix until the content of the bowl is crumbly.
	- If it stays dusty, your butter wasn't molten enough. Put the whole bowl in the microwave and heat it up a bit.
4. Add:
	- 400g M&M's or another form of chocolate chips.
5. Continue mixing until the dough is still crumbly but sticks together in large clumps.
6. Prepare oil on an oven tray.
7. Take a big spoon of dough per cookie, roll up in ~4cm balls, put it on the tray.
8. Bake the tray for 8 minutes in the oven.
9. Let it cool down.
