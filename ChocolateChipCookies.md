Recipe for chewy chocolate chip cookies
---------------------------------------
Based on a recipe by my grandmother (yes, for real), with adjustments by my father and me.

Ingredients
-----------
- 300g flour (575mL)
- 175mL brown sugar, pressed
- 175mL crystal sugar
- 200g butter
- 1 medium egg
- 1 tea spoon baking soda
- 1 tea spoon vanilla flavouring
- 1/2 tea spoon salt
- 400g M&M's or other form of chocolate chips

Algorithm
---------
1. Melt the butter. Be careful for explosions in the microwave. Melt it slowly!
2. Put in a bowl:
	- The flour
	- The brown sugar
	- The crystal sugar
	- The butter
	- The egg
	- The baking soda
	- The vanilla
	- The salt
3. Pre-heat the oven to 190Â°C.
4. Mix until the content of the bowl is crumbly.
	- If it stays dusty, your butter wasn't molten enough. Put the whole bowl in the microwave and heat it up a bit.
5. Add:
	- 400g M&M's or another form of chocolate chips.
6. Continue mixing until the dough is still crumbly but sticks together in large clumps.
7. Prepare oil on an oven tray.
8. Take a big spoon of dough per cookie, roll up in ~4cm balls, put it on the tray.
9. Bake the tray for 8 minutes in the oven.
10. Let it cool down on a cloth.
