Recipe for Chicken Kerrie in Pineapple
======================================
This is a recipe for chicken with kerrie flavour in a pineapple. It looks and tastes really special, but the title is half the recipe. It's just a really good combination.

Ingredients per person
----------------------
- 200g chicken
- Half a pineapple
- Kerrie powder

Algorithm
---------
1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces
2. Bake the chicken
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 10 minutes
	- Power: 7
	- Oil: Light
	- Finish up with a lid on if necessary
3. Spread the kerrie powder on the chicken at the start of its cooking.
4. Cut the pineapple in half in necessary
5. Hollow out the half pineapple.
	- An easy way is to cut through the middle deep, then make perpendicular cuts ~1cm apart. You then get thin slices of pineapple that you can pop out.
	- Leave as much pineapple juice in the pineapple as possible. Only take out the flesh.
6. Pour the chicken into the hollowed out pineapple and serve.

Criticism
---------
- The cooking duration is a guess.
- The pineapple juice doesn't cover all the chicken. Maybe merge it a bit in there?
- More kerrie is more better.
