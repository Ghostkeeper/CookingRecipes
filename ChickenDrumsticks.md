Recipe for chicken drumsticks
=============================
Easy and deliciously salty and fatty, but fairly high calorie and it takes a long time to cook.

1. Bake:
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 20 minutes
	- Power: 7
	- Oil: Medium
2. Turn often, especially at the end.

Criticism

- The tendons tend to stay tough.
