Recipe for Cous Cous
====================
A tasty vegetarian dish with how I prefer my cous cous.

Ingredients per person
----------------------
- Cous cous, 100g
- 3 carrots
- Half a bell pepper
- Half an avocado
- Cashew nuts to flavour
- Cloves, whole
- Cloves, powdered
- Cilantro

Algorithm
---------
1. Dice the carrots, avocado and bell pepper.
2. Heat a pan of water to cooking. Add whole cloves to the water to steep.
3. Add the couscous to the pan, cook it with the lid on.
	- Duration: 9 minutes
	- Power: 6 or 5 to prevent it from overflowing.
4. After 2 minutes, add the carrots to a separate pan.
	- Pan: Any
	- Duration: 7 minutes
	- Power: 7
5. 4 minutes later, add the bell pepper to the pan.
6. Once all is ready, let the water leak out of the cous cous and put it in a bowl.
7. Add the bell pepper, carrots, avocado and cashew to the bowl.
8. Spice with additional cloves (powdered) and cilantro. Mix well.

Criticism
---------
- The carrots don't fit very well. Replace with something crunchy?
