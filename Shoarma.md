Recipe for loose shoarma
========================
Here's how to bake shoarma properly, either for loose shoarma in another dish, or on wraps or buns.

Ingredients
-----------
- 500g shoarma

Algorithm
---------
1. Bake:
	- Pan: Big 7-ply DeMeyere
	- Duration: 9 minutes
	- Power: 9
	- Oil: Medium
2. Don't stir too often in the beginning. You want some of these pieces to cook more thoroughly for extra crisp.
3. Towards the end you'll need to stir often to prevent burning the food.

Criticism
---------
- Tender but not crispy. To get out of local optimum, try at power 10 but shorter and turn often.
